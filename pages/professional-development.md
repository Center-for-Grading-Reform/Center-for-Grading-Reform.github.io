We offer a variety of professional development workshops on alternative grading practices for both K-12 and postsecondary instructors, both virtually and in-person.  These workshops can be as short as an introductory hour long workshop up to a week-long intensive workshop, depending upon the needs of your group of instructors. If you are interested, please reach out to [Sharona Krinsky](mailto:sharona.krinsky@thegradingconference.com)
