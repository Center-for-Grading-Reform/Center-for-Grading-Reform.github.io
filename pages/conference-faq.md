<dl>
<dt>Will the conference sessions be recorded?</dt>
<dd>
As a general rule of thumb, yes! However, this is subject to the permission of the presenters.
</dd>

<dt>Will presenters’ slides be available?</dt>
<dd>
As with recordings, this is up to the presenters, but we strive to collect and share them whenever possible.
</dd>

<dt>When will the recordings be available?</dt>
<dd>
Recordings are typically made available to registered participants by the end of June (look for an email with a link), and posted publicly by the end of August.
</dd>

<dt>Where are the Zoom links to the sessions?</dt>
<dd>
A website containing all the zoom links will be emailed out by June 7, two days before the conference. If you don’t receive it (and have double checked your spam folder), contact us at info@thegradingconference.com.
